# Effective Unit Testing

Unit testing is something many developers do today. Why do some tests age better than others? Why do some tests grow with the code while others are re-written or deleted at the first opportunity?

It's no coincidence that the ones that live exhibit certain positive characteristics. They provide enough context to future readers to understand what's happening, while keeping the test [DRY] enough to not drown in implementation details Effective unit tests can't live on their own, they need good implementation code to make them effective.

Having written a lot of tests, I've seen first-hand which ones age better than others. After reading [Working Effectively with Unit Tests] by [Jay Fields], I better understand why. 

At April's CIJUG, [Dan Mullins] will walk through his personal unit testing evolution and discuss why it was implemented that way and what caused it to age poorly. He'll also talk about how good tests need good implementations to be their best.
