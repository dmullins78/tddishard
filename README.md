# Effective Unit Testing

Unit testing is something many developers do today. Fewer are writing effective unit tests. Why do some age better than others? Why do some grow with the code while others are re-written or deleted at the first opportunity?

It's no coincidence that the ones that live exhibit certain positive characteristics. They provide enough context to future readers to understand what's happening, while keeping the test [DRY] enough to not drown in implementation details Effective unit tests can't live on their own, they need good implementation code to make them effective.

[Dan Mullins] has written a lot of bad tests. Some are bad right away, some are bad 30 days later, and some go bad once another developer has to make changes. After reading [Working Effectively with Unit Tests] by [Jay Fields], it became clear why some tests age better than others. Effective unit tests strike the right balance between context and clarity.

At April's CIJUG, [Dan Mullins] will walk through his personal unit testing evolution and discuss why it was implemented like that and why it aged poorly. He'll also talk about how good tests need good implementations.
